1.I make the project2, I think in the Excel there would be a lot of data, which is a good chance to use the Excel and Matlabs to analyze the data which we used in the life. 
2.For the first part, I follow the instruction. For the second part, I choose a GDP and years form, I firstly use the excel to do some calculate, which to find the max, min, average and sum. Then I set a level of the data which give him a level which I hope to give it. Then I use this data to draw the year-meaan, year-sum, level-pie graph, also I use the MATLAB to do the Gradient analyze and draw the graph from the result I get. For the third part, I use the cellfun() to find the answer which I need and give out the result.
3.I learned some special functions in Excel such as Vlookup, Sumif and so on, also I learn the gradient method in matlab.
